Conversely to winpexpect.pyWARNING, having pexpect.py in this directory seems 
to break winpexpect!

Instead, on the freezing system install winpexpect from its source tarball:
	http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/w/winpexpect/winpexpect-1.5.tar.gz#md5=552583220943d7c74d49056a9a17de9a

Leave winpexpect.py in infobiotics.core alone and it should get used instead.

Whether it will get bundled correctly by py2exe is another matter.
