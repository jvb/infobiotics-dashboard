Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/products)
---------------------------------

Qt is available under Qt Commercial, Qt GNU LGPL v. 2.1 and Qt GNU GPL v. 3.0 
(adapted from http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/licensing)


PyQt (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
--------------------------------------------------------------

PyQt is available under the following licenses.

    * GNU General Public License v2
    * GNU General Public License v3
    * PyQt Commercial License

PyQt, unlike Qt, is not available under the LGPL.

If you use the GPL version of PyQt then any code you develop with it must be 
distributed under a compatable license. Like the GPL version of Qt, PyQt grants 
an exception to the GPL that specifies the list of licenses that you may use. 
The full text of the exception can be found here and a copy is included in the 
PyQt source package.

If you are unable to distribute your code under the terms of the GPL then you 
must purchase a commercial license.

Please contact sales@riverbankcomputing.com if you would like a copy of the 
PyQt Commercial License.

QScintilla (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/qscintilla/intro)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

QScintilla follows a similar licensing model to that used by PyQt and is 
available under the following licenses.

    * GNU General Public License v2
    * GNU General Public License v3
    * QScintilla Commercial License

If you use the GPL version of QScintilla then any code you develop with it must 
be distributed under a compatable license. Like the GPL version of Qt, 
QScintilla grants an exception to the GPL that specifies the list of licenses 
that you may use. The full text of the exception can be found here and a copy 
is included in the QScintilla source package.

If you are unable to distribute your code under the terms of the GPL then you 
must purchase a commercial license. At the moment the commercial version of 
QScintilla is only available as part of the commercial version of PyQt.

Please contact sales@riverbankcomputing.com if you would like a copy of the 
QScintilla Commercial License.
