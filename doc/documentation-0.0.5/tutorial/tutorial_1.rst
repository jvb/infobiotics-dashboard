Tutorial Using the Infobiotics Modelling Language
######################################################

With this tutorial you will learn how to use the **Infobiotics workbench** using its own modelling language for the specification of your models. We will illustrate its different features using an example comparing three basic gene regulatory mechanisms, namely, **gene unregulated expression (UnReg)**, **positive autoregulation (PAR)** and **negative autoregulation (NAR)**.  

The example used in the tutorial can be downloaded from this link: `autoregulation model <http://www.infobiotics.org/infobiotics-workbench/various/autoregulation.zip>`_. Please download and extract it to your favourite location.

Infobiotics workbench provides a user-friendly front-end allowing the modeller to specify cellular models, analyse and optimise them. Start the Infobiotics workbench by double clicking on the corresponding icon located on your desktop (Windows) or by choosing it from your Applications menu (Mac/Linux). The following window will appear.
