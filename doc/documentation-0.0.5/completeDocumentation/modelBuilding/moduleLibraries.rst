Library of Molecular Interaction Modules
===========================================

The *Infobiotics Workbench* supports the definition of **libraries of molecular interaction modules** which allows the user to specificy the set of rules in a model of an individual cell in a modular manner. Our modules facilitate the hierarchical, incremental and parsimonious development of the specifications of the molecular interactions associated with *SP-system* models of individual cells as explained in the following sections:
