The Repressilator
########################

===========================
Introduction
===========================
 
The **Repressilator** is one the first implemented *synthetic genetic circuits*. It was developed by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler [Elowitz2000]_ . It has been used as a canonical example in synthetic biology in various P system studies [Gheorghe2009]_. 

The **Repressilator** consists of three genes codifying three repressors. Namely, the operon lactose repressor, *lacI*, the repressor form the tetracycline transposon, *tetR*, and a repressor from the Î» phage virus, *cI*. These genes are conected in a synthetic gene regulatory network such that LacI represses the expression of the tetR gene, which in turn represses the cI gene. Finally the cycle is closed as CI represses the expression of the lacI gene.

The Model
=========================

Our model of the *Repressilator* consists of a single bacterial cell modelled as a *SP-system* identified with the name *repressilatorCell*. The molecular interactions in this *SP-system* are defined in a modular manner by using the modules in the library *basicLibrary*::

      Const({X},{c_1},{l}) = 
      {
          r1: [ geneX ]_l -c_1-> [ geneX + rnaX ]_l 
      }

      CoopNegReg({X,Y},{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5,c_6},{l}) =
      {
          r1: [ proteinX + geneY ]_l -c_1-> [ proteinX_geneY ]_l 
          r2: [ proteinX_geneY ]_l -c_2-> [ proteinX + geneY ]_l

          r5: [ proteinX_geneY ]_l -c_5-> [ proteinX_geneY + rnaY ]_l 
          r6: [ proteinX2_geneY ]_l -c_6-> [ proteinX2_geneY + rnaY ]_l 
      }

      PostTransc({X},{c_1,c_2,c_3},{l}) = 
      {
          r1: [ rnaX ]_l -c_1-> [ ]_l
          r2: [ rnaX ]_l -c_2-> [ rnaX + proteinX ]_l 
          r3: [ proteinX ]_l -c_3-> [ ]_l 
      }

   endLibraryOfModules

The modules in this library model the following basic gene regulatory mechanisms:

  * *Const({X},{c_1},{l}):* This module describes the constitutive expression of a gene $X$ which produces the corresponding messenger at a rate of *c_1*
