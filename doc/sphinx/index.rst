Infobiotics Dashboard documentation
===================================

Infobiotics Dashboard (henceforth *dashboard*) is a graphical interface 
to the `Infobiotics Workbench <http://www.infobiotics.org/infobiotics-workbench/>`_ 
components *mcss*, *poptimizer* and *pmodelchecker*. The dashboard provides an
environment for editing P system models of biological systems, setting up and 
running experiments on models, plotting experimental results, and will in the 
future enable model creation and experimentation to be automated via the Python
scripting language.

This documentation will guide you through the installation of the dashboard,
introduce its features and explain, with examples, how to create, experiment on
and analyse the behaviour of P system models.
