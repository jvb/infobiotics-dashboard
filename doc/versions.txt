#TODO rename to versions.txt
0.0.12 skipped as a 0.0.12 with Jamie's 12/01/2011 fix is already in the apt repository. #TODO remove in version 0.0.14.dev

'''Describes how the dashboard version is determined. 

'setup.py' reads 'VERSION.txt' (both in source root) to get the version number 
(in the format <major>.<minor>.<micro>.<releaselevel>, e.g. 0.0.13.dev) and 
overwrites 'infobiotics/__version__.py' with commented source that uses the new
version number.

'infobiotics/__version__.py' keeps that string in "__version__" and splits the 
major, minor and micro numbers into a tuple of ints called "__version_info__".

'infobiotics/__init__.py' does #TODO move to infobiotics.dashboard.__init__?
"import __version__.__version__, __version_info__",
"version = VERSION = __version__"
and
"version_info = VERSION_INFO = __version_info__"
for redundant access to these attributes.
