Infobiotics Workbench - The ultimate goal of systems biology is the development of executable in silico models of cells and organisms, while synthetic biology aims to implement, in vitro/vivo, organisms whose behaviour is engineered. P systems, computing with membranes, abstract the structure and function of the living cell into a formalism upon which we are building a multi-scale modelling environment. By applying discrete, numerical simulation algorithms to P system models of quorum sensing in the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and root development in Arabidopsis thaliana, we aim to understand the stochastic processes governing these model organisms, and guide laboratory experiments. In addition we use evolutionary optimisation and machine learning (Genetic Programming, Learning Classifier Systems, Support Vector Machines, etc) to estimate parameters and discover structures that match observed behaviour in cellular networks with the intention of isolating these modules for use in the design of synthetic organisms. Dissipative Particle Dynamics is used for simulating (proto-)membranes. These activities are complemented by other groups in the SynBioNT Synthetic Biology Network for Modelling and Programming Cell-Chell Interactions.
