=================================================
Things to do, bugs to fix, feature requests, etc.
=================================================

Unsorted
--------

get_surfaces to multiple runs

plots preview dialog hide invariants check box does nothing and is permanently disabled

rename simulation results to mcss results

test mcss results with some very large models

disable legend in plots

test matplotlib images by 'got here'

CLI progress bars for mcss, etc using pexpect as proof of concept


RelativeFile validation should respect filters.

RelativeDirectory should not descend from RelativeFile because this makes it harder to subclass RelativeFile and make Directory equivalent that works the same.

Test simpler pexpect example, especially for PRISM output, and see what gets passed when spawning 'mcss' using logging (try Popen.communicate)

change CorePlugin to DashboardPlugin *

Project management (using Single Project plugin?)

Results management using Sumatra

Make size of Mayavi screenshots adjustable

Make Mayavi videos on Debian using ffmpeg

Sync Mayavi cameras http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/auto/mlab_figure.html?highlight=sync#sync-camera

code coverage

unit tests (before refactoring!)

decouple writable, readable from RelativeFile

decouple directory trait of file editors?

FIXMEs

TODOs




General
-------

Use open lpp file for model parameter for each experiment. * 

Help URLS for Dashboard main window - requires altered actions strategy to HelpController
    link to issue tracker http://bitbucket.org/jvb/infobiotics-dashboard/issues?status=new&status=open

Welcome perspective *

Splash screen

Delete temporary files: NamedTemporaryFile(delete-False) means I have to do this manually. *

Perform should *always* prompt to save parameters and only perform when saved - only true of interactive mode?

Disabled 'Perform' button should have helpful tooltip populated by has_invalid_parameters()

README, etc.

Unified 'Open File...' service/action

Parse command line arguments to Dashboard using argparse, file names to Unified file opener service 

Adding Dashboard progress bars (with Experiment and Results buttons) to view list

Introduce notion of sessions (interactive/unattended, GUI/non-GUI)




Frozen
------

IBW should install shortcuts to All Users when 'Run as...' Administrator on University computers - alternative is to not install in Program Files (probably more natural) - maybe suggest this on running the installer - still can't add to path though!

Matplotlib and Mayavi2 toolbar icons not rendering properly in frozen builds, where are the images in these?

py2exe log error dialog fix in root


PModelChecker
-------------

BoundsEditor for PModelCheckerResults axes




POptimizer
----------

Item('popsize', label='Population size', visible_when='object.para_opti_algo_ != "CMA-ES"'),

need to expect not just prefix1.txt but prefix?.txt where ? is num_initials

[set to undefined?] make maximum number of modules in a model '' by default but erroneous using TextEditor(evaluate-evaluate_function)




SimulatorResults
----------------

Stacked plots should have only one molecules label, grid lines and only one time axis (see POptimizerResults)

Grid lines and legends should be switchable: add to matplotlib_.py? (and rename that to something more explicit)

Plots in PlotsPreviewDialog of SimulatorResults for 'NAR' but not 'modules'.

BoundsEditor for Simulation Results time start/stop




Language
--------

Lexing of P system files *

Autocompletion from parsed data structure
