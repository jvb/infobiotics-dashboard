Perform should *always* prompt to save parameters and only perform when saved.


default prism model should have random name - tempfile

disabled perform button should have helpful tooltip coming from has_invalid_parameters

IBW should install shortcuts to All Users when 'Run as...' Administrator on University computers - alternative is to not install in Program Files (probably more natural) - maybe suggest this on running the installer - still can't add to path though!

All temporal formula parameters change when on changes!

Need poptimizer output for Windows video

temporal_formulas file should have enter_set=True, auto_set=False






README, etc.

Tidy root.

Delete temporary files: NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) means I have to do this manually. 

temporal_formulas file only saved when 'temporal_formulas' changed, always save.


* Matplotlib and Mayavi2 toolbar icons not rendering properly in frozen builds, where are the images in these?

* Stacked plots should have only one molecules label, grid lines and only one time axis.

* Grid lines and legends should be switchable: add to matplotlib_.py? (and rename that to something more explicit)

* Plots in PlotsPreviewDialog of SimulatorResults for 'NAR' but not 'modules'.

* make maximum number of modules in a model EMPTY - use TextEditor(evaluate)
