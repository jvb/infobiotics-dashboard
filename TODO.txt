has anyone tested the latest linux release as i'm not getting any graphs
when opening the plot window after performing a simulation. is it just my
installation?

* POptimizer - prefix Strs rather than ParamsRelativeFile - still necessary?

* Saving text files - rolling our own Envisage TextEditor plugin

* lexing and autocompletion of P system files using QScintilla

* Welcome perspective

* splash screen

* argparse

* unified 'Open File...' action

* change CorePlugin to DashboardPlugin

* change infobiotics.common to infobiotics.core

* introduce notion of sessions (interactive/unattended, GUI/non-GUI)

* Test simpler pexpect example, especially for PRISM output, and see what gets passed when spawning 'mcss' using logging

* Adding Dashboard progress bars to view list

* BoundsEditor for PModelCheckerResults axes

* BoundsEditor for Simulation Results time start/stop

* Project management (using Single Project plugin?)

* Results management using Sumatra

* Make size of Mayavi screenshots adjustable

* Make Mayavi videos on Debian using ffmpeg

* code coverage

* unit tests (before refactoring!)

* decouple writable, readable from RelativeFile
