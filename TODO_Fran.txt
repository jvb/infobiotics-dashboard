! View model only works on 2nd time and causes model to be translated AND causes parameters to be loaded.

! lower, step, upper of a TemporalFormulaParameter should all have the same precision when floats (PRISM uses the precision to create a finite set of intermediates) but for now just make them Int.

* Create model parameters each time modelParameters.xml is changed (what about wiping existing values?)

* Translate automatically for PRISM and MC2 in _model_specification_changed 
    (thought I did but I guess this needs testing)

* Only load modelParameters.xml once after 'Translate', not for new experiment.

* Only enable view once PRISM_model has been translated

* Don't hide window if only translated OR remove 'Translate' from tasks

* ModelParameters <undefined> to start with (desirable?)
